        3.3.2 - Evidence Gathering and Handling:
        Although the primary reason for gathering evidence during an incident is to resolve the incident, it may also be needed for legal proceedings. In such cases, it is important to clearly document how all evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved.

        Evidence should be accounted for at all times; whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each
        partyâ€™s signature. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence.

        3.3.3 - Identifying the Attacking Hosts:
        During incident handling, system owners and others sometimes want to or need to identify the attacking host or hosts. Although this information can be important, incident handlers should generally stay focused on containment, eradication, and recovery. Identifying an attacking host can be a time-consuming and futile process that can prevent a team from achieving its primary goalâ€”minimizing the business impact.
